### ItemKNN

Recently I participated in recommender system contest, where 
I managed to place among the top 10. In this notebook I provide 
the code and comparisons of my Item Based K Nearest Neighbours 
with some other algorithms.

After my best system was a plain ItemKNN. 
On the competition platform I achieved 38.3% accuracy calculating 
recommendations on the whole dataset. This is a quite good result. 
It could be better, if I had an inside about time factor of listens, meaning a time sequence of listens. 
Further improvements can be achieved being provided with more information about user.
